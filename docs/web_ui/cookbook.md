## Creating Your Cookbook
Once you have finalised your recipes of choice, you will be required to give the cookbook a `Name` and `Description`. This would help in identifying and organisation the cookbook.

After filling up the form in the modal, click on **Create Cookbook* to create your new cookbook.

Upon successful creation of the cookbook, the newly created cookbook is now available in the list of cookbooks on the Cookbook page.
