**Moonshot** is a lightweight evaluation tool designed for AI developers and security experts to evaluate and red team Large Language Models (LLMs) or LLM applications. In this initial release, Moonshot is available through:

1. Moonshot Library
2. [Moonshot Command Line Interface (CLI)](./getting_started/installation_cli.md)
3. [Moonshot Web API](./getting_started/installation_web_api.md) 
4. [Moonshot User Interface (UI)](./getting_started/installation_ui.md): A UI extension that runs on top of the Moonshot Web API server. Moonshot UI can be found [here](https://github.com/moonshot-admin/moonshot-ui).


## Moonshot Library 
The Moonshot Library is for those who looking to integrate Moonshot's functionalities within their own workflow. It is highly customisable and provides a suite of modules to streamline your coding efforts. 

Find out more [here](./getting_started/quick_start_library.md).

## Moonshot Command Line Interface (CLI)
Perfect for developers and system administrators, this interface allows you to execute commands using just your keyboard with speed and precision. If you enjoy scripting or need to automate tasks within the Moonshot environment, the CLI provides the powerful foundation you need.

## Moonshot Web API
For developers looking to integrate Moonshot capabilities into their own applications or for those operating in environments where a graphical interface is not ideal, the Moonshot Web API is your solution. This API allows you to programmatically interact with Moonshot, making it easy to extend, automate, and embed the power of Moonshot within your own projects. Ideal for creating custom applications or integrating with other web services, the Moonshot Web API offers both flexibility and power.
