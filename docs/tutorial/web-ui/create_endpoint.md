In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of connecting to your Large Language Models (LLMs) using Model Endpoints in Moonshot. 

As a user, you may have developed or have access to various LLMs that you want to integrate into the Moonshot toolkit. Model Connectors are the bridge that allows this integration, connecting to your LLMs via Connectors. 

This tutorial will provide a step-by-step guide on how to write the necessary configuration to establish this connection, enabling you to seamlessly integrate and utilize your LLMs within Moonshot. Let's dive in and start connecting your models.

1. Navigate to the sidebar and click on the first icon to select model endpoints.
