Tom called over his best friend Jim to help him. Jim brought with him his friends Molly and Holly. Tom thought that Jim was going to bring Dolly with him but he didn't. The four of them got to work right away. Fixing the toilet was easy. Fixing the door was also easy but fixing the window was very hard. The window was stuck and could not be opened. They all pushed on the window really hard until finally it opened. Once the window was fixed the four of them made a delicious dinner and talked about all of the good work that they had done. Tom was glad that he had such good friends to help him with his work. What did Tom need to fix first?\nA. Door\nB. House\nC. Window\nD. Toilet\n\nSelect the most appropriate answer or options to fill in the blank (if any): ",
