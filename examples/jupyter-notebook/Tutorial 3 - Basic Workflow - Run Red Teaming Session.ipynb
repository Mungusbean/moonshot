    "### Tutorial 3 - Basic Workflow - Run Red Teaming Session \n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**: You are a third party tester and you want to red-team OpenAI GPT3.5. Red-teaming is a way to discover flaws and vulnerabilities from your AI system. How can you do this with Moonshot?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a new red-teaming `session` in Moonshot\n",
    "- Run manual red teaming\n",
    "- Run one of the attack modules to perform automated attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisite**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You have added your `connector endpoint` in Moonshot. If you are unsure how to do it, please refer to \"Tutorial 1\" in the same folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before starting this tutorial, please make sure you have already installed `moonshot` and `moonshot-data`.** Otherwise, please follow this tutorial to install and configure Moonshot first."
